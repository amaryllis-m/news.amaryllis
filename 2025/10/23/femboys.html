	  <h2>What is a Femboy?</h2>
	  <p class="text">Femboys are a subset of the male gender (or masculine learning identity) that tends to take part in more feminine expressions. A key difference between femboys and transgender women/ transfeminine people is that femboys still identity on the male spectrum considering the sex binary, however have interests or dress in a way that is socially deemed as feminine, especially when considering a Western perspective. Below are examples of different ways to dress up as a femboy:</p>
	  <p class="text">However, it is important to note that there can be a lot of crossover between Femboy and Transfem fashion, especially when considering feminine clothing many socially transitioning outfits a transfem girlie would pursue.
