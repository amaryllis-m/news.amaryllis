	  <p class="text">Witness have recently come out about Hiruni Premaranthe's actions in the Curtin Library's 5th floor unisex bathrooms. This comes after an investigation into the actions that have been going on in the Curtin Library restrooms, as faculty and students alike has raised concerns.</p>
	  <p class="text">On Reddit, a student has said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/curtin/comments/1kklxlq/some_of_yall_needa_chill_in_level_5_bro/">"some of yall needa chill in level 5 bro"</a> in regards to this issue.</p>
	  <p class="text">One of the people identified in the investigation is Hiruni Premaranthe, first year medicine student and the developer* of Missing Dog, if she starts coding. Multiple witnesses have commented on her "disappearing to the bathroom during [their] study sessions and spending a suspicious long time in there".</p>
	  <p class="text">Among these witnesses is friend of Hiruni and fellow medicine student, Kat, who said that Hiruni should just come out and give Christian 'Marigold' Choe the biggest queerbaiter award because he deserves it more.</p>
	  <p class="text">Unfortunately, Christian was not available to comment on this.</p>
